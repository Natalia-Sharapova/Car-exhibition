# Car Exhibition (Auto show)

## Hello! This is an app where I trained my skills in creating tableViews, data entry interfaces and custom cells. Here were used UIKit, MVC, tableViews and custom cells, 

### This is an improvised application for registering a car at an auto show. 

### Added the following features:

1. The main screen with animated button for the entry

The type of keyboard changes depending on the information you need to enter. All text fields must contain at least 1 character. 

4. You can choose the image source: camera or library. And choose required date
